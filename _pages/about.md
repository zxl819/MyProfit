I'm Xinlei Zhao. Currently, I am studying techniques of computing and telecommunications. In this place, I want to record some of my expericence of scientific research of my postgraduate period.

I think ðŸ¤” im the type of guy who what share different things in different social media. So i decide to choose github as my study sharing places. Hope I can have somethings to share and recordðŸ˜ƒ.
<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
