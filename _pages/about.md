I'm Xinlei Zhao. Currently, I am studying techniques of computing and telecommunications. In this place, I want to record some of my expericence of scientific research of my postgraduate period.

I think ðŸ¤” im the type of guy who what share different things in different social media. So i decide to choose github as my study sharing places. Hope I can have somethings to share and recordðŸ˜ƒ.
